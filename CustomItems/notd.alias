Upon reducing a creature to 0 hit points, the necklace siphons a bit of the life essence from the creature, adding one charge to it.  While the item has any charges, it provides +1 to spell save DCs spell attack rolls.  This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.  Usage: bolster, cast, call."

This creature is treated as if it was created by a casting of Animate Dead.
