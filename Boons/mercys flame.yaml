      Once per long rest, when Rolan reduces a creature to 0 HP with a melee
      weapon attack, he may choose instead to leave them at 1 HP and render them
      stunned until the end of their next turn.


      During this stunned condition, Rolan (or an ally) has advantage on Insight checks against them.

      If Rolan offers this mercy, he gains 10 temporary hit points and advantage on his next Persuasion or Religion check related to redemption or penance.


      This is Kaelreth's echo at workâ€”mercy offered at the blade's edge. It allows Rolan to walk the razorline between vengeance and grace.
