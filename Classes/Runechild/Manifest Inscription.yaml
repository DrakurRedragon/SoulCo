      Also at 6th level, you can reveal hidden glyphs and enchantments that
      surround you. As an action, you expend one charged rune to reveal hidden
      or invisible arcane traps, marks, runes, wards, sensors, or glyphs within
      60 feet of you. They glow with dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 minute.


      You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to discern the nature of any magic revealed in this way for the duration. If the glyphs you reveal mean something in a language you canâ€™t read, you can understand them while they are glowing as if you knew that language.
